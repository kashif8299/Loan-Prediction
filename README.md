# 💼 Loan Prediction Analysis (Python Project)

![Loan Prediction Banner](images.jpeg)

This project explores a real-world **loan prediction dataset** using Python. It aims to identify the key factors that influence loan approval decisions by performing data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and machine learning modeling.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts whether a loan will be approved or not based on applicant information like income, credit history, education, loan amount, and more.

It includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Predictive insights and business impact

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Applicants with **higher incomes** and **positive credit history** have a greater chance of loan approval.
- **Self-employed applicants** and those with **larger loan amounts** may face more rejections.
- **Credit history** is the most influential feature in loan approval decisions.
